# React Hooks Practice Summary

This project demonstrates the use of various **React Hooks** with small, easy-to-understand examples.

---

## 🔹 useState Hook

Used to declare and manage state in functional components.

---

## 🔹 useRef Hook

Used to access and interact with DOM elements directly, without re-rendering.

---

## 🔹 useMemo Hook

Used to memoize functions or values to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations.

---

## 🔹 useContext + createContext Hook

Used to create global state that can be shared across components without prop drilling.

---

## 🔹 onChange Event

Used with `useState` to capture input changes in real-time.

---

## 🔹 map Function

Used to loop through arrays and display data in JSX format.

---

## 🔹 Light Toggle Example

A `useState` based example to toggle a bulb image between ON and OFF states.
